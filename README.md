[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).


```hcl
module "ec2_service_alarms" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=tags/0.1.0"
  namespace      = "cp"
  stage          = "prod"
  name           = "app"
  existing_sns_topic_arn   = "arn:::::some-sns-arn"
  instance_ids   = ["i-036eab29c7531c7bf", "i-036eab29c7djdnju83"]
}
```
